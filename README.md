# Talespinner

Welcome to Talespinner, which is a project in its early stages to couple
a collection of stories with tooling for creating custom books
containing arbitrary subsets of those stories, selectable by tag.

Put more straightforwardly, the basic idea is this:

**I'm expecting to become a father soon.  I want a huge collection of
fairy and folk tales, so that when my kid gets really interested in
frogs, I can easily put together a custom collection of frog stories
just for them.**

All of the stories associated with this project are in the public
domain in the United States and are sourced primarily from Project
Gutenberg.
